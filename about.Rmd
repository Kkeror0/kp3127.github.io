# Hi, I'm Keyu

I'm a graduate student in Epidemiology Department at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, focusing on public health data science and biostatistical modeling.  

Beyond academia, I’m also passionate about the intersection of biomedical research and quantitative finance — applying analytical thinking to both public health and investment problems.

This website serves as a portfolio of my academic and professional work for **P8105: Data Science I**, including reproducible R analyses, dashboards, and course projects.
